# Friend Finder Network
The older you get, the harder it is to find places you can meet people who enjoy the same things in life as you.

With the Friend Finder Network, we do all the hard work. You don't have to rely on your workplace, or randomly bumping into someone in order to meet people to socialize with.

With FFN, you let our system determine your best matches based on common personality traits and characteristics.

## Developer Details | Jamie K. Ferrugiaro

My name is Jamie Karen Ferrugiaro, and I'm currently a student in Rutger's web development bootcamp. I'm halfway through my program and most of the projects on this GitHub are still currently a part of that learning process.

### This App Development
For this app I was able to include my knowledge of express and node.js to create a network where people could connect based on a very scientific test of their personality.
